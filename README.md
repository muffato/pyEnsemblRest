# pyEnsemblRest

Object-oriented Python API for Ensembl, automatically built upon the REST API.
It requires a single configuration file (see config.xml) to describe the object type generated by each endpoint, as well as its accessors.

Doxygen documentation has been generated and is available on the [gh-pages
branch](http://muffato.github.io/pyEnsemblRest/). However, since most of
the objects are dynamically created, it isn't as complete as the `help`
command in the Python shell.

*This is a toy project ! I don't intend to develop it any further.*
