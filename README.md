# pyEnsemblRest

Object-oriented Python API for Ensembl, automatically built upon the REST API.
It requires a single configuration file (see config.xml) to describe the object type generated by each endpoint, as well as its accessors

Doxygen documentation is available via rawgit: https://rawgit.com/muffato/pyEnsemblRest/master/doxygen/index.html
Since most of the objects are dynamically created the doc is not that great :/

This is a toy project ! I don't intend to develop it any further.
